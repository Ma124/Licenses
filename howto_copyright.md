## How to write a Copyright Notice

There are four important elements that all copyright notices need:
1. &copy; sign or something similar
2. year of creation
3. author
4. rights statement

### &copy; sign
This is exactly what you expected it to be:
* &copy; (`&copy;` in HTML)
* (c)
* "Copyright"
* or a combination of the above

#### Example:
`Copyright (c)`

### Year of publication
In projects that aren't published in just one year (**blogs**, **software** etc.) you need to specify the first and last year.  
For software that means the release year of first and last version.  
For blogs the year when the first post was made and the release year of the last post.  

#### Examples:
One year (Photos etc.): `2018`  
Multiple years (Blogs, Apps etc.): `2005-2018`  

### Author
* your full name
* pseudonym
* website
* or a combination of the above

#### Examples:
`John Smith`  
`johnsmith.com`  
`John Smith, johnsmith.com`  

### Rights statement
* "All rights reserved.": Everyone needs permission from you
* "Some rights reserved.": There's a license
* "No Rights Reserved.": Public domain (also consider using [The Unlicense](page/unlicense), [CC 0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/))

### Putting it together
You can:
* put a comma between name and year
* a dot at the end

#### Examples:
`Copyright (c) 2018 Ma124 All rights reserved.`  
[`Copyright 2018 Ma124, ma124.github.io`](page/expat.html)  
`© 2003-2018 John Smith Some rights reserved`  
`(c) 2018, ma124.github.io`
